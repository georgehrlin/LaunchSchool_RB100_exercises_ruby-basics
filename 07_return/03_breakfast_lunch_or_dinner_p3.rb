=begin
The code will print:
Breakfast
This is because when calling method meal, it will return only one string,
'Breakfast' since the keyword return is applied before the string. The last
line of 'Dinner' will never be reached because of the use of the keyword return.
=end

=begin Additional Notes
The keyword return within a method definition exists the method.
