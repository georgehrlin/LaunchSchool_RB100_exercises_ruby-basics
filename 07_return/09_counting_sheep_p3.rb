The code will print:
0
1
2
2
The invocation of method count_sheep terminates when sheep points to 2 and
reaches the keyword return. Therefore, the return value of count_sheep is 2,
and p count_sheep will output another 2 to the terminal.
=end
# WRONG

=begin
LMFAO.
OK.
Hahaha there is nothing after return, so nil is returned. Why did I assume 2
would be returned when there is literally nothing written after return haha!?
Gee no wonder I was wondering why the code uses p for the last line.
